# CtrlAltUpgrade

Welcome to the CtrlAltUpgrade repository! This is a collection of scripts and tools that I've found useful in my role as a K-12 systems administrator. The resources here are primarily written in PowerShell and are organized into different directories based on their usage context.

## What's Inside

This repository contains a variety of resources, organized into the following directories:

- **AD**: Scripts related to Active Directory operations.
- **Intune**: Scripts for managing and automating tasks in Microsoft Intune.
- **SCCM**: Scripts for System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM).

Each directory contains scripts and tools relevant to its category. Feel free to explore each directory to find the tools that might be useful for you.

## How to Use

To use these resources, navigate to the directory of interest and view the individual scripts. You can copy the scripts directly or download the individual files as needed. Make sure to adjust any scripts to fit your specific environment and needs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a script or tool that you think would be a good fit for this repository, feel free to open a pull request. Please include a brief description of the resource and how it's used.
